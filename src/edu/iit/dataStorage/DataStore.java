    /*An abstract class, in the context of Java, is a superclass that cannot be instantiated and is used to state
    or define general characteristics. An object cannot be formed from a Java abstract class; trying to instantiate
    an abstract class only produces a compiler error. The abstract class is declared using the keyword abstract.

    Subclasses extended from an abstract class have all the abstract class's attributes, in addition to attributes
    specific to each subclass. The abstract class states the class characteristics and methods for implementation,
    thus defining a whole interface.*/
